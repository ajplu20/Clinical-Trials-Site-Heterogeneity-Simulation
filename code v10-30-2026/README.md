# Impact of Site-Level Variation on Statistical Power and Type 1 Error Control in Multicentre Trials: A Simulation Study

This repository contains the R code used in the paper  
**"Impact of Site-Level Variation on Statistical Power and Type 1 Error Control in Multicentre Trials: A Simulation Study."**

## Contents

- `main.R` — Simulates simple multicentre trials to estimate power and type I error across different numbers of sites.  
- `main_basket.R` — Same as above, but for the basket-trial extension.  
- `find_power_fp_threshhold.R` — Calculates the number of sites required to reach 90% power or 5% type I error (simple trials).  
- `find_power_fp_threshhold_basket.R` — Same as above, but for the basket-trial setting.  
- `Rshiny_app/` — Contains the code for the interactive R Shiny tool accompanying the paper.
